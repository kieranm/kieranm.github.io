## About
I work as a Backend Engineer, tech lead, and Open Banking lead at 
<a href="https://monzo.com/" target="_blank">Monzo Bank</a> -- where I've been since early 2018.
I was previously a Software Engineer at <a href="https://skyscanner.com/" target="_blank">Skyscanner</a>, 
and had a similar role at Bank of America.

I studied at the University of York where I obtained a starred first class Master of Engineering
(MEng) degree in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. I have also received scholarships, 
grants, and awards from the Royal Academy of Engineering, Institution of Engineering and Technology,
and the British Computer Society.
